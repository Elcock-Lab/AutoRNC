this folder contains 1 file necessary for building the construct shown in Figure 2A of the paper:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] P12345.fasta         - sequence of the construct

note that P12345.pdb, list_of_bloks and list_of_ss_elems are not applicable in this case...

make the comfile that should allow us to build this structure:
--------------------------------------------------------------

note that in the following command - (which is admittedly on the long side...) - all paths
that are user-provided must be preceded and ended by \' characters - this involves the
arguments [6], [7], [8], and [9] - I know this is an inconvenience, but it's done so that
Fortran can read the paths correctly without getting screwed up by the '/' symbol

--> comfile_build_nascent_chain

(this will take only about a second to complete)

arguments:

[ 1] name of .fasta
[ 2] total # residues (in this example, 204)
[ 3] build from residue # (in this example, 203 since residue 204 is resolved in 5UYM_L24; SEE BELOW)
[ 4] list_of_bloks   (tertiary structure)
[ 5] list_of_ss_elems (secondary structure)
[ 6] path to ribosome structure template
[ 7] path to protein info (usually this folder)
[ 8] path to codes
[ 9] path to dipeptide libraries
[10] sidechain_mode =0 for all-atom ; =1 for C-beta only ; =2 for C-alpha only
[11] nmodels desired
[12] yes/no to use ribosome
[13] intra-chain clash distance
[14] inter-chain clash distance
[15] nbacktrack
[16] iblock: if >0 then add blocking atoms around the iblock'th res of nascent chain

arguments 2 and 3 will have the following relationships for the various templates:

for 5UYM: arg#3 = ( arg#2 -  1 )
for 3JBV: arg#3 = ( arg#2 - 17 )
for 7OIZ: arg#3 = ( arg#2 - 16 )

this is because each of these ribosome templates has a different number of
resolved residues at the C-termini of their nascent chains.
 
then run the comfile thus:
--------------------------

nohup ./comfile_build_nascent_chain &

you can monitor progress by doing:
----------------------------------

tail -f nohup.out

the final RNC structures will be in:
------------------------------------

AHEMODEL_001/P12345.AHEMODEL.pdb
